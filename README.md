Play out the classic Conways Game of Life simulation with this C# application!

## What is CGOL
This is a grid-based simulation. Each cell represents a "living creature".

If a living cell has more than three neighbors, it dies (overpopulation).
If a living cell has less than two neighors, it dies (underpopulation).
If a living cell has 2 to 3 neighbors, it lives.

If an empty cell has three live neighbors, it becomes alive (reproduction).
